/**
  * MaskPosition
  * This object describes the position on faces where a mask should be placed by default.
  *
  * @param	point	The part of the face relative to which the mask should be placed. One of “forehead”, “eyes”, “mouth”, or “chin”.
  * @param	x_shift	Shift by X-axis measured in widths of the mask scaled to the face size, from left to right. For example, choosing -1.0 will place mask just to the left of the default mask position.
  * @param	y_shift	Shift by Y-axis measured in heights of the mask scaled to the face size, from top to bottom. For example, 1.0 will place the mask just below the default mask position.
  * @param	scale	Mask scaling coefficient. For example, 2.0 means double size.
